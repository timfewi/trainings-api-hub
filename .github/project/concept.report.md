Application Concept: "API Sandbox"
The core idea is to provide students with a personal, on-demand, and disposable REST API environment for practicing frontend development. This "API Sandbox" will simulate a typical e-commerce backend. Each student gets their own containerized instance of this API, which they can create and destroy at will. This ensures a clean, isolated, and repeatable testing experience.

User Flow
Authentication: A student logs into the web application.

Dashboard: After logging in, the student sees a simple dashboard. It will show their currently running API instance (if any) or a button to create a new one.

Instance Creation:

The student clicks "Create New API Instance."

The backend provisions a new Docker container.

Inside this container, a Node.js/Express application starts, which serves the dummy e-commerce REST API. This API is pre-populated with a new, randomly generated set of data (products, users, orders, etc.).

The backend assigns a unique URL (e.g., https://api.your-domain.com/instance/{some-random-id}) to this container.

API Interaction: The dashboard displays the unique base URL for their API instance, along with a list of available REST endpoints (e.g., GET /products, GET /products/:id, POST /orders). The student can now use this URL in their own frontend projects to make API calls.

Instance Deletion: When the student is finished, they can click a "Delete Instance" button on their dashboard. This action will stop and remove their specific Docker container, freeing up resources.

Tech Stack
This stack focuses on a consistent TypeScript experience across the entire application.

Frontend: Angular

Why: A robust framework that provides a solid structure for building the user dashboard. Its powerful features for handling services and HTTP requests make it ideal for interacting with your backend.

Backend: Node.js with Express.js or NestJS

Why: Both are excellent choices for building the main backend API that manages user authentication and container lifecycle.

Express.js is lightweight and flexible.

NestJS is a more opinionated framework built on top of Express that enforces a structured, modular architecture similar to Angular, which could be beneficial for consistency.

Database (for the main app): PostgreSQL or MongoDB

Why: To store user information and metadata about their active API instances (like the container ID and unique URL).

Containerization: Docker

Why: This is the core of the application. Docker allows you to package the dummy e-commerce API into a self-contained, isolated environment. You can programmatically start and stop these containers for each student.

Container Management: Docker SDK for JavaScript

Why: This library allows your main backend (Node.js) to interact with the Docker daemon to create, start, stop, and remove containers programmatically.

Dummy API Data Generation: Faker.js (or a similar data-generation library)

Why: To create realistic and varied fake data (product names, prices, user details) every time a new API instance is created.

Development and Implementation Concept
1. The Dummy E-commerce API (The "Product")
Create a separate Node.js/Express project for the dummy API.

Define the REST endpoints:

GET /products

GET /products/{id}

GET /categories

POST /cart

POST /orders (simulates creating an order)

GET /users/{id}

This API will not have a persistent database. On startup, it will use a library like Faker.js to generate a set of data and store it in memory (e.g., in a simple JavaScript array or object). This ensures that every new instance is fresh and fast to spin up.

Crucially, create a Dockerfile for this project. This file will define how to build a Docker image of your dummy API.

2. The Main Backend (The "Factory")
This is your primary Node.js server. It will handle:

User Authentication: Standard login/registration.

API Endpoints for the Frontend:

POST /api/instances: The endpoint your Angular app will call to request a new API instance.

DELETE /api/instances/{instanceId}: The endpoint to destroy an instance.

GET /api/instances: To get information about the user's current instance.

Docker Integration:

When the /api/instances endpoint is hit, use the Docker SDK to:

Pull the latest version of your dummy e-commerce API image.

Create a new container from that image.

Start the container.

You'll need a mechanism to route traffic to the container. A simple approach is to map the container's internal port to a unique, available port on the host machine. A more advanced setup would involve a reverse proxy like Nginx or Traefik to handle routing based on subdomains or paths.

Store the container ID and its public-facing URL in your database, associated with the logged-in user.

Return the URL to the frontend.

3. The Angular Frontend (The "Control Panel")
Create an Angular application with:

A login page.

A main dashboard page protected by an authentication guard.

An Angular service to handle all HTTP calls to your main backend.

The dashboard will fetch the user's instance information.

If an instance exists, display the URL and the list of available endpoints.

If no instance exists, show a "Create" button.

Implement the methods to call the POST and DELETE endpoints on your main backend to manage the lifecycle of the API instance.
